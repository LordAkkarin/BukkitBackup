Backup [![Build Status](http://www.evil-co.com/ci/plugins/servlet/buildStatusImage/BB-MASTER)](http://www.evil-co.com/ci/browse/BB-MASTER)
===============
The Backup plugin for Bukkit/Spigot allows you to automatically back up your plugins
and worlds to your file system or Amazon Glacier.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

	mvn clean install

Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
